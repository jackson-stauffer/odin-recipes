        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This Baked Mac and Cheese recipe is easy to make with a creamy 3-cheese blend and perfectly cooked macaroni.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb elbow macaroni</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon <strong>each</strong> onion powder, pepper</li>
                <li>3 cups cheddar, <em>shredded</em></li>
                <li>2 cups gruyere, <em>shredded</em></li>
                <li>1 cup gouda, <em>shredded</em></li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to <strong>325° F</strong>. Measure out ingredients before beginning.</li>
                <li><strong>Begin boiling pasta water</strong> for the macaroni while you prepare the cheese sauce. <strong>Salt the water once a boil is reached.</strong> (I use 1 tbsp. kosher salt.)</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, <strong>melt butter</strong> in a large pot over medium heat. Use a silicone spatula to <strong>stir in the flour. </strong>Continue to stir for 2 minutes, it should start to turn a light brown.<strong> Add the heavy cream/milk in small splashes,</strong> stirring continuously. (If you add it too quickly you’ll “break” the roux and the sauce will be thin.)</li>
                <li>Let it simmer, uncovered, while you <strong>boil the macaroni for 1 minute less than al dente</strong> (about 7 minutes, refer to package). Stir both the sauce and the macaroni periodically.</li>
                <li><strong>Add the seasonings and hot sauce to the sauce.</strong> <em>Remove from heat.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Gradually sprinkle in 4 cups of shredded cheese.</strong> Stir continuously until smooth and combined. If it seems too thick, add a splash of milk.</li>
                <li> <strong>Drain the macaroni</strong> and add it to the warm pot you boiled it in. <strong>Pour the cheese sauce on top</strong> and stir to combine. Transfer to a lightly greased 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. <strong>Top with remaining 2 cups of cheese.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Bake for 20 minutes.</strong> If desired, broil at 450 for 3 minutes to brown the top. Serve!</li>
